Java todo-list (save & load to/from .json)

My first experience with save/load to and from .json.

Input/output via console (and .json-files):
-create new todo-lists (to .json),
-load existing todo-list (from .json),
-see list details,
-add tasks (via task builder),
-update status (pending, active, completed + timestamp).

Some spaghetti-code...
Next up: clean code, add features.
